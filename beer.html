        Brewed using a consistent malt base, but with a different and seasonal
        hop combination you'll find a different take on the pale ale style with
        each variation.

          <span class="beer-variation-label">01 | NZ Cascade &amp; Dr. Rudi</span> - Using all NZ hops,
          you'll find flavours and aromas of grapefruit, lemongrass and other
          citrus notes and a gentle bitterness backing it all up.
