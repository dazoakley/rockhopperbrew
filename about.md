Rockhopper Brewing Co. is a new (early/mid 2016) independent brewery based in
Luton, Bedfordshire. It’s the result of a passion for homebrewing, and beer in
general that very happily got a bit out of hand.

We will be brewing beer that is unpasteurised, unfiltered and packed to the
brim with flavour – this is the kind of beer we love, and we hope you do too.
