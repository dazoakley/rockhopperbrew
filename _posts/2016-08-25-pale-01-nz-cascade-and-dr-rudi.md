Our first brew is ready!  The first out of the gate is a modern style
pale ale made with New Zealand hops.  It's been a long time coming, but we
hope you'll think it's been worth the wait!

Made using Maris Otter, Munich, Cara-Pils and Biscuit malt for a firm, but
light malty backbone and hopped using all New Zealand hops - Pacific Gem for
bittering, and then NZ Cascade and Dr. Rudi through the rest of the boil
(including generous additions at flameout and dry hopping), this is the kind of
beer that we really like and wanted to start with.

You'll find flavours and aromas of grapefruit, lemongrass and other citrus
notes and a gentle bitterness backing it all up.

We've already got a couple of casks out and about, we'll try to keep the list
of stockists and pubs up to date on our [find some](/find-some) pages.  The
next time we brew this batch it will also be available in bottles.
