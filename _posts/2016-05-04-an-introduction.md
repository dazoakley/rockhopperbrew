Hello and welcome to the online home of Rockhopper Brewing Company.

This all started as a bit of a dream about 18 months ago, when my wife and I
were looking to move home.  I've been a keen homebrewer for a number of years
and am quite actively involved in the [London Amateur Brewers] homebrew club,
and one of the things we were looking for in our new house was a space for me
to do my brewing so I could get all of the equipment out of the way - and more
importantly, out of the kitchen and dining room!

To cut a long story short, we got really lucky.  Not only did we find a great
house, we found a great house with a rather large garage on the side already
setup with electric, water and sewage - jackpot!

At the same time a few of my friends were in the process of opening their own
breweries (in garages or small industrial units) and this really set the seed
in my mind.  Do I just have a really sweet homebrewing space, or do I go for
it and try to squeeze a small commercial unit in the garage?  I was fortunate
enough to still have some savings left after buying the house, and I'm even
more lucky to have an understanding and supportive wife, so after six months
of "Can I, can't I?" we went for it.

Where we are now is that we have a 2BBL (~330 litres) brewhouse, 2 fermenters,
some casks, some bottles and a bunch of ideas (we're planning on kegs too in
the future, but the area we're in isn't quite ready for them just yet).  We're
almost ready to go - first trial batches should be happening in May, with the
plan to start selling very soon after to local pubs, bottle shops, restaurants
and anyone else who is interested in getting good beer out in Luton, the home
counties and the surrounding area.

I'll follow up this post soon with more details and photos of the build and
what it takes to setup a brewery from the business side, and hopefully news of
the first few batches and what to expect from us.  But in the mean time do
drop us an [email], [tweet], or message on [facebook] if there's a question,
or if you just want to say hi.
