We're happy to announce our next two beers are now heading their way out of the
brewery! :)

### Pale|02

Our second pale ale, Pale|02 takes us in a slightly different direction from
our opening Pale|01. Coming in at 4.7% ABV and using a combination of British
(Target) as well as New Zealand (Cascade) hops we wanted to show that you really
can make a good hop forward pale ale with British hops.  Expect subtle grapefruit
and citrus flavours combined with a gentle spicy bitterness from the traditional
British hops, all once again sat on top of a solid malty base.

### Saison-ish|01

This is a new style for us, we hope you like it as much as we do.

Saison-ish|01 is a cross between a Belgian Saison and a hopped up, but malty
pale ale and comes in at 6.0% ABV.  You'll get a yeast derived spicy character
and fruity esters traditional to the saison style, coupled with berry fruit
notes from the pacific gem hops and a good dose of maltiness from a
non-traditional grain bill.

### Availability

Both these beers, along with a re-brew of Pale|01 are now starting to make
their way out of the brewery.  All three beers will be available in cask and
330 ml bottles.  We will keep the [find some] page up to date with
