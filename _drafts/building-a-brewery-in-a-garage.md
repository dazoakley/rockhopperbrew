excerpt: Like all good things, we're small, really small.

Like a lot of other nano breweries out there we're not based in an industrial estate, or an idilic country location, we're situated in a garage, in a residential area, on the side of our house.  This has various pros and cons when it comes to starting a fledgling brewery and we'd like to use this blog post to detail some of those along with some photos and insight into the setting up of the brewery.

First, let's start with the downsides...

Brewing is a manufacturing business - you will be judged solely on the quality and the consistency of your product.  At such a small scale (essentially not much bigger than some home brew setups), this can be a challenge if you're not on top of your cleaning and process control.  Here's the main areas we've thought about:

* **Cleaning and sanitation** - if you're not on top of this, you're going to produce bad beer, simple as that.  There's no real trick to this... **INSERT SHRUG**
* **Consistency and quality** - like the cleaning and sanitation, there's no real trick, just keep good brew logs, learn from your successes and mistakes, get to know your ingredients (all ingredients will vary from batch to batch so you need to compensate for this), and make sure you don't let a bad beer out into the market.
* **Ingredients and freshness** - being so small we have next to no storage space, and no cool room, so this one is forced upon us.  We're not going to be buying in bulk orders of malt and hops and leaving them lying around for months before use, instead we're going to be buying the ingredients in fresh for each couple of batches.  This approach will help with the freshness but it also means that we can't guarantee a consistent supply of all ingredients so a set core range of beers will be a challenge.
* **Finances** - this is an obvious one.  In manufacturing you make great gains via economies of scale, you can buy more, cheaper ingredients, produce more beer per batch, invest in more automation, so that you can make a batch of beer quicker and easier etc etc.  We're essentially an overgrown homebrew setup ------------------------------

As we've only done the one batch so far we can't really comment on how we're doing with regards to this so far, but we think we've got the correct processes in place to maintain a good standard.

Now the good things...

* **Ingredients and freshness** - Yes, this is a challenge (in getting hold of ingredients in the first place), but it's also a wonderful opportunity - we can't (and don't have to) brew the same beer(s) day-in day-out.  This means we can't have a core range of beers, instead we're planning on having a range of core _styles_, with each example of the style built upon a similar recipe, but we'll mix up the ingredients to showcase what is in season and available to us.  This should not only keep the brewing and recipe development interesting for us, but it also means that there will be constantly varying range of beers out there for you to try. :)
